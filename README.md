# Elsa

This project was made for a 24h hackaton and is for educational purposes only. Our theme was the song Let it go from Disney's Frozen soundtrack. Elsa is a cryonics company that allows you and your loved ones to never miss each other while waiting for a better future.

We created a single page web application using the following stack:
* Java backend using Spring MVC and providing a REST API. 
* Frontend includes a single HTML5 file, displaying different views based on user interaction. DOM is manipulated via JavaScript & JQuery and populated by the REST API, whose data is fetched through AJAX requests.
